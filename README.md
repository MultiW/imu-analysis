# IMU Data Analysis

An application for IMU sensor data analysis. 

## Context

In cross-country ski training, wearable [IMU sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit) are placed on athletes' poles and boots to capture movement data. These IMU sensors measure triaxial linear acceleration, triaxial angular velocity and triaxial magnetic force and record them as time-series data. Data analysts extract insights from this data, and coaches use these insights to provide feedback on athletes' skiing techniques. In many instances, identifying the ski steps taken by an athlete during a workout is an important first step in IMU data processing that opens the way to further analysis of skiing techniques. Thus, the goal for this application is to provide an easy way to identify the ski steps in a workout.
